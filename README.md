HOW TO RUN: 

The node_modules folder should ideally contain everything you need. So try to:
Make sure that you have node.js installed.
navigate into the directory this file is in, then type in node server.js.
then hit enter and go to http://localhost:8080/  . 

IF THAT DOESN'T WORR:

1) make sure you have npm and node js installed.. and make sure you have WiFi connection
2) navigate to your directory in terminal
3) type in 'npm install' and hit enter. this should download everything needed for the code to run. 
5) type in 'node server.js' on your terminal and hit enter
4) go to: http://localhost:8080/ 



This should get the job done, hopefully.

Here's what every file/directory does.

libs: stores the d3.js stuff necessary to make the map.
node_modules: stores all the dependencies necessary to run this code, like openai and express
index.js: makes the map, primarily
popups.js: makes the inventory, chat and magic popups
server.js: the node.js server
talkToServer.js: the bit that talks to the server :D
